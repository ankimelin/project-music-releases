# Music Releases
A music release site listing new albums and singles using a Spotify data.

## The problem

First React project! 

Started with console.log to check what data we have, and to find the paths to the data I wanted. Created a couple of components, which in the end was completely restructured. Also created one css file for each component in the end.
